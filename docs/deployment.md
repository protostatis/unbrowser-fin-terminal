# Production Deployment

The production terminal is served at
`https://unchainedsky.com/unbrowser/fin-terminal/`. This repository does not
deploy directly from a branch. Releases are pinned to an immutable source commit
in the [`unchained-infra`](https://github.com/protostatis/unchained-infra)
Compose manifest and deployed through that repository's GitHub Actions workflow.

Use the GitHub Actions path for production releases. Do not use the manual SSH
deployment fallback for a normal terminal release.

## Release Process

1. Validate the source revision:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   npm run build
   git diff --check
   ```

2. Push the release branch and resolve it to a full immutable commit SHA:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/signal-dossier
   git ls-remote --exit-code --refs \
     https://github.com/protostatis/unbrowser-fin-terminal.git \
     refs/heads/feature/signal-dossier
   ```

3. In `unchained-infra`, create a release branch from current `main`. Replace
   the `fin-terminal.build.context` Git ref in `docker-compose.yml` with that
   exact 40-character SHA. Never use a mutable branch ref such as
   `#feature/signal-dossier`.

4. Update the matching SHA assertion in
   `unchained/test_fin_terminal.py`, then run the infrastructure checks:

   ```bash
   python deploy/test_fin_terminal_secrets.py
   cd unchained
   python -m unittest test_fin_terminal
   ```

5. Open and merge the infrastructure PR into `unchained-infra` `main`. Its
   `ci.yml` workflow runs the release checks and places the current `main`
   revision at the protected GitHub `production` environment gate.

6. Approve the `deploy-production` GitHub Actions job only after confirming it
   targets the intended current `main` revision. The workflow runs
   `deploy.sh`, which validates the private-core overlay, deploys the Compose
   stack, checks health, and rolls back a failed candidate.

## Deployment Contract

- Build with `PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/unbrowser/fin-terminal/`.
- The container listens on port `8787`; `/api/ready` is the readiness check.
- Caddy owns route authorization and injects the terminal proxy token. Do not
  expose port `8787` directly or bypass Caddy.
- Production research uses the Docker-internal `unbrowser-mcp` endpoint. Do
  not substitute the shared public development endpoint.
- The terminal remains a singleton per process. Approved operators share the
  persistent research archive and should coordinate ownership of the active
  WebSocket session.

## Post-Deployment Verification

- Confirm the GitHub Actions production job succeeded.
- Confirm the deployment host reports `fin-terminal` healthy and
  `GET /api/ready` returns HTTP 200 from inside the container.
- Confirm logged-out requests to `/unbrowser/fin-terminal/` return HTTP 401.
- Confirm an approved user can load the terminal and establish
  `/unbrowser/fin-terminal/ws` through Caddy.
- Confirm a direct container-network request without the injected proxy token
  returns HTTP 403.
